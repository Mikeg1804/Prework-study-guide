            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript. When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically. To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
